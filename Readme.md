## Introduction

In the present scenario, waterborne diseases are increasing day by day, and it is a significant concern in the world. The waterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that are directly transmitted when contaminated water is consumed.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a portable device that can detect waterborne diseases quickly and accurately. This device aims to provide a cost-effective and efficient solution for monitoring water quality in real-time.


## Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Sensors, Microcontrollers
- **Software**: Python, Firebase
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Cloud**: Firebase
- **UI**: Qt Designer


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Saravanakumar2003/Final-Year-Project.git
    cd Final-Year-Project/Software/python
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up Firebase:
    - Follow the instructions in [firebase_setup.md](/firebase_setup.md) to configure Firebase.

## Usage

1. Run the main application:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start detecting waterborne diseases.

## Results

The device was tested with various water samples, and the results showed a high accuracy in detecting common waterborne pathogens. Detailed test reports can be found in the [test_reports](tests/test_reports) directory.

## Conclusion

This project is aimed to successfully develop a portable water-borne disease detector that can be used for real-time monitoring of water quality. The integration of machine learning and cloud technologies provided a robust and scalable solution.
