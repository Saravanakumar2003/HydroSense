## Introduction

In the present scenario, waterborne diseases are increasing day by day, and it is a significant concern in the world. The waterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that are directly transmitted when contaminated water is consumed.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a portable device that can detect waterborne diseases quickly and accurately. This device aims to provide a cost-effective and efficient solution for monitoring water quality in real-time.


## Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Sensors, Microcontrollers
- **Software**: Python, Firebase
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Cloud**: Firebase
- **UI**: Qt Designer


## Status
The project is currently in the development phase. The team is working on integrating the hardware components with the software and cloud services. The machine learning models are being trained and tested to detect waterborne diseases accurately.
